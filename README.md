This game is very simple. But if you are bored or just want to train your perseverance and attentiveness. Let's play Brain-even. You need only get one answer "yes" or " no " to a very simple question...is there life on Mars?..Oh, this is a joke...the question is - is the number even? You have three attempts for this. I answered three times correctly - you are the winner!

Did you know that there are 6 signs that you don't like prime numbers: 1. Try not to use them. 4. You do not allow others to use it. 6. Try not to notice them.
A prime number (prime) is a natural number that has exactly two different natural divisors-one and itself. Let's play Brain-prime and answer the question whether the number is prime or not. Do you have three attempts and if you answered correctly - you are the winner.
